<h1><strong>How I Passed Cisco Certified DevNet Associate Exam?</strong></h1>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge lover of vendor technical certifications, but I do enjoy taking them now and again to drive myself out of my comfort zone and learn about new tools or ideas that I haven&#39;t encountered before.</p>

<p>This was my primary motivation for seeking the <a href="https://www.study4exam.com/cisco/cisco-certified-devnet-associate-exam-questions" target="_blank"><strong>Cisco Certified&nbsp;DevNet Associate credential</strong></a>. After +3 years as a Network Automation Engineer, I asked myself the following question:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Is it feasible to pass the exam without any prior knowledge or preparation?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>And my quick response is, &quot;<strong>Yes, you can.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>But, because I imagine you&#39;re hesitant to invest your money on a test without some knowledge, I&#39;m going to share with you a 6-hour strategy that will prepare you to pass this exam (or point you towards a longer-term plan).</p>

<h2><strong>1 - Check the blueprint</strong></h2>

<p>The first thing you should do is review the certification test overview and the six subjects. If you&#39;ve been working on DevOps and/or network automation for a time, you&#39;ll note that the Cisco proprietary platform elements are the only ones you don&#39;t know about (assuming you haven&#39;t worked with them previously). Even though this portion amounts to around 15% of the total, it&#39;s crucial to note that the needed level is a high level of knowledge, so you can still meet it.</p>

<h2><strong>2 - Test your skills</strong></h2>

<p>Now it&#39;s time to figure out how you&#39;d do in front of the exam using our existing abilities.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.study4exam.com/" target="_blank">Study4Exam</a></strong> offers amazing preparation assessment tools in two different formats. They have:</p>

<p>Cisco Certified DevNet Associate Desktop Practice Test</p>

<p>Cisco Certified DevNet Associate Web-Based Practice Test</p>

<p>Both of them are enriched with a lot of assessment features. Test your skills properly with these practice test and give them a whole lot of time after preparation.</p>

<h2><strong>3 - Review missing topics</strong></h2>

<p>Spend time investigating the topics or technologies that you are less familiar with, using the notes from past examinations as a guide; just Google should be enough.</p>

<h2><strong>4 - Test your skills again</strong></h2>

<p>The second set of testing has begun. The previous examinations can be retaken with fresh questions to provide you with a new selection of things to consider.</p>

<h2><strong>5 - Review missing topics and map Cisco products</strong></h2>

<p>It&#39;s time to delve even further into things you believe should be better understood.</p>

<p>In addition, I would propose creating a basic table for each of the Cisco products specified in the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-associate/" target="_blank"><strong>blueprint</strong></a>, where you should include a brief description and the kind of API authentication utilized for each product.</p>

<h2><strong>Extra resources</strong></h2>

<p>Obviously, this plan doesn&#39;t account for foundations and basic knowledge (as it assumes that you already have), but some good resources you can use if required are:</p>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>

<p>This strategy worked for me, and I believe it can work for others as well, but don&#39;t consider it a tried-and-true method of passing the DevNet Associate exam.</p>
